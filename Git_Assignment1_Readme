GitHub and GitLab are prominent remote code hosting services that provide comparable version control and collaboration capabilities. 
However, there are a number of considerations, such as preferences and requirements, that affect the decision between the two. 
Github is more well-known, has a larger user base, and a more developed community than GitLab, hence I favour using it instead. 
It is widely used by developers and organisations worldwide and is acknowledged as the industry standard. 
This popularity results in a wider pool of contributors, improved interoperability with different third-party technologies, and a variety of resources and documentation available.
